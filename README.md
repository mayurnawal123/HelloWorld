Intro to GitHub

# Create and use a repository
Click on + sign in the right hand side to do it. 
Keep the name as simple and relevant as possible for better rememberance. 


# Start and manage a new branch
Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.
By default your repository has one branch named main which is considered to be the definitive branch. 
We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to main.

When you create a branch off the main branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of main as it was at that point in time. 
If someone else made changes to the main branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

# Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits

In GitHub,  developers, writers, and designers use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our main (production) branch. 
When a change is ready, they merge their branch into main.

To make a new branch, click on the name of the file, in the box type the name of your branch and press enter. 

# Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits
Click on Green Push Button. 


# Open and merge a pull request

Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. 
When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. 
Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.

As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.

By using GitHub’s @mention system in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they’re down the hall or 10 time zones away.

You can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself. It’s a great way to learn the GitHub flow before working on larger projects.
